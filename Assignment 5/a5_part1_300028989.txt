
#Question 1a)
Each max function costs n operation time, and since there are four max
functions, it would cost 4n operation time. The big O for this is O(n).


#Question 1b)
List "a" items are transferred to temp_list -> n
temp_list is sorted -> nlogn
For loop runs n//3 times -> n//3
The big O for this is O(n + nlogn + n//3)
Simplifies to O(nlogn)


#Question 1c)
List "a" items are transferred to temp_list -> n
temp_list is sorted, costing nlogn operation time -> nlogn
For loop runs n times -> n
The big O for this is O(n + nlogn + n)
Simplifies to O(nlogn)


#Question 1d)
The function sum_tri(a, x) first sorts the array, and then nested loops go over
the array to find potential indices. Sorting runs in nlogn time and the nested
loops run in n^2 time.
The worst case performance is O(n^2)
